According to Wikipedia, Reality Mining is:

> the collection and analysis of machine-sensed environmental data pertaining to human social behavior, with the goal of identifying predictable patterns of behavior. 

To the best of my knowledge, this term originated with work done by 
Alex "Sandy" Pentland's group at MIT. This work has been documented in a number 
of places, ranging from technical articles to a book released by the MIT Press by
Nathan Engle and Kate Green. Broadly speaking, Pentland and company have been
trying to use a combination of cheap sensors, wireless networks and massive
data processing capabilities to try to tease out insights about how people
communicate and, more globally, how they go about their lives. 

In many ways, this concept of "reality mining" captures very succinctly
the core of aspects of what I've been thinking about for a very long time: how
do you transform the byproducts of an instrumented world into meaningful insights?
