## <span class="fa fa-bar-chart"></span> What I do these days

I just started working as consultant for the [McKinsey Journey Analytics](https://www.mckinsey.com/solutions/journey-analytics) 
practice. Basically, it combines everything I like to do professionally and
a lot that I like to do for fun in one spot :)

## <span class="fa fa-ticket"></span> What I did until recently

Until recently, I was the director of machine learning at a company 
called [StubHub](http://www.stubhub.com) which is a fairly large 
marketplace for secondary ticket exchange. 
My team at StubHub was responsible for pretty much all of the machine 
learning on the site, including the pricing guidance tools, the ticket
recommendations, and a bunch of other things. What that meant in practice is 
that we worked on some pretty interesting data problems ranging from
applied econ to various flavors of personalization.

## <span class="fa fa-dollar"></span> What I did before that

Before StubHub, I spent the bulk of my career building a pair of
data science focused companies. The first one gave me the chance to work
with the smartest collection of people I've ever known on some really
hard problems for the government. The more recent one gave me the chance
to work with some pretty large, well-known companies helping them
understand how to use data to better understand their customers or, more 
often than not, use data and analytics to create new customer experiences.

## <span class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></span> What I teach 

Scattered throughout all of my day jobs, I've been developing and 
teaching machine learning & data science courses at Boston University's 
[Questrom School of Business](http://www.bu.edu/questrom/). 
I also taught tech strategy to engineering students trying to get a sense for
how to make money off their great ideas. 
For a few years I did this as a full time gig, 
but lately I've been doing it part time. Unfortunately, with the move to
McKinsey it seems like this will be coming to an end for the foreseeable
future. <span class="fa fa-frown"></span>

## <span class="fa fa-plane"></span> What I do for fun

Aside from my family, the things that I do for fun include

* Data ... lots of data. Mostly using R.
* Playing with my Raspberry Pi's
* Football. 
* Movies. "The Evil Dead 2" and "Tucker and Dale vs Evil" are two 
of my favorite movies
* Books. 
* Anything that combines most of the above
